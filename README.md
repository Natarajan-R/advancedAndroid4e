ATTENTION:
========

At the time of writing, the book and these code samples were written for the Eclipse ADT Bundle (Android IDE) because Android Studio was just released as a preview software.  I have included additional code samples to work with Android Studio, so you will find both Eclipse code samples and Android Studio code samples.  To get up and running with these code samples with Android Studio, see the books blog found here, with a detailed blog post describing where to learn how to get setup with Android Studio, Java, AVDs, and how to run the samples here: http://advancedandroidbook.blogspot.com/2015/08/4th-edition-code-samples-upgraded-for.html

Welcome
========

Welcome to the code samples that accompany the Addison Wesley Professional book titled "Advanced Android Application Development, Fourth Edition", written by Joseph Annuzzi, Jr., Lauren Darcey, and Shane Conder.

These code samples will help you understand the contents of the book by allowing you to interact with application projects that implement many of the Android SDK features discussed throughout.

You can download the files as a ZIP package using the Download ZIP button seen towards the right of this page.

You could download all the files as a ZIP: https://github.com/lambo4jos/advancedAndroid4e/archive/master.zip

Or you could issue the following command from a command line to get the code.

`git clone https://github.com/lambo4jos/advancedAndroid4e.git`


FOR ECLIPSE ADT BUNDLE (Android IDE) ONLY
========

For the `Chapter 17 - Location and Maps` project `SimpleLocation` and for the `Chapter 20 - Analytics` project `SimpleStats`, make sure to configure the `google-play-services_lib` project as a library project. The library can be found within the directory `../<path_to_sdk>/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/`

For the `Chapter 07 - Advanced UI` project `SimpleActionBars`, make sure to configure the `android-support-v7-appcompat` project as a library project. The library can be found within the directory `../<path_to_sdk>/extras/android/support/v7/`



Happy learning!
